This simple waterproof temperature sensor aimed at measuring temperature in places such as lakes and a rainy environment. Using Arduino,one could obtain the time, voltage (Vm), Resistance and finally temperature. Place the sensor in contact with the surface you would like measure the temperature of. Connecting the Circuit to a USP or external battery, one could retrieve the data, and save it on a file or SD card in the case of an external battery usage. 

1) Ardunio time_volt_res.ino code

2) Matlab Code ResT.m

3) Matlab Code Tembf.m.
